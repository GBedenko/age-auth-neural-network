# 303COM Individual Project (Convolutional Neural Network)

Convolutional Neural Network developed with PyTorch to predict age based on dataset of images of people and their ages

Neural network is trained using this dataset: https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/

Created April 2019

This project was for my BSc Computer Science - Individual Project module
